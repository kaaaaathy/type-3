    <br>
    <!-- <h2 style = "padding-top:0px"> -->
    <h2>Typography 3 is the culmination of RISD’s typography sequence, with an emphasis on typography and contemporary
      display platforms. Advances in software and hardware have created new opportunities for how language is written,
      sequenced and accessed. Projects in this course depend on altered states, in which the content, composition, and
      context all are potentially at play. Students will continue to develop proficiency in designing for static
      compositions while extending the meaning and voice of that work across multiple platforms. Students will have
      ample opportunity to further shape their perspective and individual voice in relation to contemporary typography.
      <br><br>
      This is a studio course. Some class time will be used for discussions; most of the time we will be working in
      class, often on a computer. There is an expectation that students work both individually and in groups and be
      prepared to speak about their own work and the work of their peers in supportive and respectful ways. A laptop and
      relevant software are required. Please also be in the practice of using a sketchbook, though I assume almost all
      of you are already.
