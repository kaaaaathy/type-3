        <marquee scrollamount="3">A glyph (/ɡlɪf/ GLIF) is any kind of purposeful mark. In typography, a
            glyph is "the specific shape, design, or representation of a
            character".[1] It is a particular graphical representation, in a
            particular typeface, of an element of written language. A grapheme, or
            part of a grapheme (such as a diacritic), or sometimes several graphemes
            in combination (a composed glyph)[a] can be represented by a glyph.

        <marquee direction="right" scrollamount="3">There’s a basic injustice in the worldwide spread of the
            transparency
            and the projection of Western thought. Why must we evaluate people on
            the scale of the transparency of ideas proposed by the West? … As far as
            I’m concerned, a person has the right to be opaque. ✰ ÉDUOARD GLISSANT ✰
            Glitch feminism urges us to consider the in-between as a core component
            of survival — neither masculine nor feminine, neither male nor female,
            but a spectrum across which we may be empowered to choose and define
            ourselves for ourselves. … Through the digital, the body “in glitch”
            finds its genesis. ✰ LEGACY RUSSELL ✰

                A collection of works from students in kathy's Type 3 class exploring

                If we suppose all these signs and symbols to be already known to the
                reader, as they will be in the future, will we be able to write a
                story that makes sense? A certain elasticity of interpretation is
                clearly necessary.
                <br /><br />
                We shall try to use the symbols as the words are used in a poem: they
                will have more than one meaning, and the meanings will change
                according to where they are put.
